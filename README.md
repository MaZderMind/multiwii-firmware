This is a Branch is configured for my Copter named "HeavyDuty".
It contains all special configurations made for it, including broken out LEDs and a Buzzer, connected via unused Gimabl pins.

This branch us used to keep track of the config created just for that copter. It may or may not be useful for other Copters. Based on MultiWii 2.2.
